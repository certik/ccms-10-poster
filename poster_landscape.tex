%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
   We compare several high-order methods for solving the radial Schr\"odinger
   and Dirac equations, in particulal spectral finite element method, $p$-FEM,
   $h$-FEM and $hp$-FEM. All methods provide robust way of calculating all
   eigenstates with any precision. They differ in the rate of convergence and
   whether a good initial mesh is needed or not, as well as providing robust
   error control.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \headerbox{Motivation}{name=model,column=0,below=contribution}{
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The need for an efficient solution to the radial Dirac equation arises
in the calculation of the equation of state and opacity of materials
under extreme conditions.  These calculations often rely on
self-consistent average-atom codes to compute the atomic structure for a
representative atom in a plasma. For plasmas at low densities and high
temperatures, a very large number of Rydberg states are accessible,
often requiring the calculation of principal quantum numbers of 100 or
higher.  This poses a challenge for the existing average-atom models,
since they have difficultly in resolving all the bound states just below
the continuum, and accurately computing the wave-function of
high-principal-quantum-number states near the nucleus.
